# 🚗 Vehicle Parking System (Python + Logisim)

A beginner-friendly Vehicle Parking System built using Python and Logisim Evolution.
The Python script manages parking slots and vehicle entry/exit through a simple console interface,
while Logisim simulates the parking logic digitally using counters, logic gates, and LEDs.

# ⚙️ Overview

Tracks total, occupied, and available parking slots

Prevents over-parking and underflow errors

Combines software logic (Python) with hardware simulation (Logisim)

# 🧠 Tools Used

Python 3+ (for logical implementation)

Logisim Evolution (for circuit design and simulation)

# 🧩 Working

Users can park or remove vehicles through the console menu

Logisim circuit uses counters and gates to simulate binary slot indication

Both programs demonstrate basic automation and digital logic design

# 🖥️ Output Example
🚗 Vehicle Parking System 🚗
Total Slots: 5
Occupied Slots: 2
Available Slots: 3

1. Park a Vehicle
2. Remove a Vehicle
3. Exit
